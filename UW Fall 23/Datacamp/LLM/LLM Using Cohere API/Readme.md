## Getting Started with Cohere API

What does Cohere do ?
Cohere offers an API to add cutting-edge language processing to any system. Cohere trains massive language models and puts them behind a simple API. Moreover, through training, users can create massive models customized to their use case and trained on their data. This way, Cohere handles the complexities of collecting massive amounts of text data, the ever-evolving neural network architectures, distributed training, and serving models around the clock.

Cohere offers access to both generation models (through the generate endpoint) and representation models (through the embed endpoint which returns an embedding vector for the input text).
